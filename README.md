## A money flow history app (for Android)

    The objective of this app is provide a service to register all things you buy, separete by categories, like food, entertainment, netflix or whatever you want. All 	categories will be created by the user. All data will be stored in the phone, no internet acess will be required (I don't trust this kind of information to any app, so I'll try to make an app that can be trusted).
    By now, it's possible to add registers and consult the average of any category. I'm working to separete the data by month and create some graphs to give a better view of your money flow.
    The reason to me make this app is that I need to controll my cash kkkkk. So I'll be a hardcore user.
    If you want to contribute, send a pull request or call me someway.
